Extra Credit: Re-Reference Interval Prediction (RRIP)

The RRIP cache replacement policy can improve the success of a working cache over the current LRU policy. RRIP works by using the knowledge of the re-reference pattern of each
cache block and replacing the block that will be re-referenced furthest in the future. This is different from current cache replacement policies that work using prediction.
